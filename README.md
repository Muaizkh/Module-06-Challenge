# Module-06-Challenge

## Description

The motivation to create this page was to allow for a place that anyone could go on to look up locations and see the weather at that speicifc time as well as the week long forecast and all other temperature related information. I built this as a way to test myself and try to improve on my JavaScript skills and as its been a difficult process of learning. Doing this allowed me to experience adding API to js and trying to figure out how to interact with it and mover aroud it. I learnt that I need to take a lot more time into learning this and trying to allow for more learning for myself.
